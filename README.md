# Pig Latin Activity

[Oday ouyay eakspay igpay atinlay?](http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin)

This was a project for LEARN Academy. We had to use the rules below to create an app that translated pig latin. This was a collaboration project between [Nic Last](https://github.com/niclast7611and) [Stephen OMarrah](https://github.com/SOMarrah).

### Rules of Pig Latin
- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- "y" is treated like a vowel in appropriate circumstances.

There are many [examples](http://funtranslations.com/pig-latin) of Pig Latin translators out there on the Internet to give you inspiration.

### Repositories
This project was completed through [LEARN Academy](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy).

- Images are stored in the assets folder. You can add more images and import them into App.js to increase the pigs that get cycled through.
- The styling is done in the App.css.
- The behaviors are all written in the App.js file.
- You can access the deployed website [here](https://swineslator.netlify.app/)
